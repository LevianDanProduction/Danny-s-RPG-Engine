# This is Dannys RPG Engine

The project originally created during 2020 lockdown in order to quench my need to go deeper into Python, allowing me to learn how to create object oriented programs as well as bring concepts and ideas into fruition in the form of an text based RPG.

Not much documentation has been made since its revival, but will at one point ensure that progress and features are properly highlighted.
## How to run
There is currently a demo game that you can play through the game, player and enemy json data files that contain all the characters, story dialogue and actions the player can take

#### In order to run it, yo will need to:
- Open up any IDE ensuring there is a clear terminal
- Ensure that you have the simpleaudio module installed
- Run the game.py file

## Tips on how to play
- When it says press anywhere press enter
- when the game presents you with numbered options, type the number that matches with your desired choice
- The keys you need for battling is the numberpad/numbers, backspace and enter on your keyboard
- If you want to go back on a choice, press enter without typing anything
- For best presentation, go fullscreen

### Warning

Using the main branch without installing simple audio or using an IDE without sound support (replit etc), the program may not work.
There is a branch for this (replit) that will work with no sound, and will not require the simpleaudio module.

Happy playing üòÅ
